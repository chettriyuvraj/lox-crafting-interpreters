Porting the tree-walk interpreter for the Lox programming language to Go. 

I am in the process of porting the Lox programming language, as described in [Part II of Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) to Go.

- Have so far managed to port the Scanner.

# Usage

- _go run [filename]_ OR _go run_ which starts a prompt for you to input your tokens.

# Output

- You can look up the [Lox syntax](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html)
- As of now, on input-ing source code, it will spit out Token objects (one per line).
